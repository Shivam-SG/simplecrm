A schema-agnostic data workspace that turns any JSON dataset into a filterable, searchable table with built-in CRM capabilities — status tracking, scoring, notes, tags, and bulk actions. Drop a Google Maps scrape today, a competitor list tomorrow, a product inventory next week — each lives in its own page with its own auto-detected schema.

Built for solo operators and small teams who routinely scrape, collect, or receive structured datasets and need to work through them systematically.

## Features

- **Auto-detected schema** — drop any JSON file and the system infers field types (phone, url, email, number, boolean, array, json, string), generates labels, and picks sensible title and dedup fields.
- **Type-aware rendering** — phones become click-to-call, URLs become external links, arrays become chips, booleans become check/X icons. Same data, different context: compact in the table, expanded in the detail panel.
- **Dynamic filters** — every visible field gets an appropriate filter control (substring, range, multi-select, has/missing) generated from the schema. Active filters surface as removable chips.
- **CRM layer on every record** — status (customizable per page), 1–5 score, append-only notes timeline, tags, and starred flag — independent of the underlying data shape.
- **Inline editing** with optimistic updates and silent rollback on failure.
- **Bulk actions** — set status / score / tag, delete across the current selection or every record matching active filters.
- **Detail panel** — slide-over with full record data, notes, tags, keyboard navigation (↑/↓ between rows, Esc to close), and an auto-detected "View on Maps" button when applicable.
- **Dedup on import** — phone-number and email normalization with `new_only` or `upsert` modes.
- **Multiple pages** — each dataset is its own page with its own schema, statuses, and emoji icon. Star the ones you use most; they pin to the top of the sidebar.
- **Dashboard** — totals, status distribution, per-page breakdown.
- **CSV export** that respects the current filter view.
- **Auth** — username/password (bcrypt) with JWT in an httpOnly, sameSite=strict cookie. No public registration; users are seeded via CLI.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.2+ (or Node 20+)
- A MongoDB connection string (Atlas free tier is plenty)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhruvRekhawat/simplecrm.git
cd simplecrm
bun install
```

Create `.env` in the project root:

```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/?appName=Cluster0
DATABASE_NAME=simplecrm
JWT_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
MSG91_AUTH_KEY=<your-msg91-auth-key>
MSG91_OTP_TEMPLATE_ID=<your-msg91-template-id>
```

Seed an admin user:

```bash
bun run seed -- --username admin --password <your-password>
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in.
